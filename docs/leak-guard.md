# Leak guard

agent-chat is a public repository, and a branch is public the moment it is pushed. The leak
guard scans text before it leaves the machine and refuses when it finds private data. This page
covers slices 1 and 2 of CC-265: the deny-list, the scanner, `agent-chat leak-scan` and the
pre-push hook on every spawned agent. The PreToolUse guard, the burndown backstop and the owner
override are later slices. The pre-push hook calls `titan-egress-scan` from
`@titan-design/egress-scan`, not `agent-chat leak-scan`: egress-scan is the scanning engine going
forward (CC-298), and this repository's scanner stays only until its remaining callers move.

## The deny-list

The deny-list is `private-denylist.json` in the agent-chat home (`~/.agent-chat/` unless
`AGENT_CHAT_HOME` moves it). The owner writes it by hand and keeps it at mode 0600. No
repository holds it, no fixture copies it, and the scanner never prints its entries.

```json
{
  "owner-email": ["someone@example.com"],
  "private-name": ["a-seat-name", "a-private-repo"],
  "private-path": ["some/private/dir/"]
}
```

Every key is optional. Any other key, a non-string entry or an empty entry makes the file
unreadable rather than silently dropping the entry.

`~/projects/<repo>` paths are not flagged, because public docs already use them.

A built-in allow-list lets synthetic fixtures pass: `/Users/example`, `/home/example`,
`/Users/test*`, and any address at `example.com`, `example.org`, `*.test` or `*.invalid`. It
applies to the matched span only, so `/Users/example/x` passes while the real home still fails.
Tests must use these forms or other made-up values, never captured real data.

## What is scanned

`--range <from>..<to>` scans each commit in the range on its own: the lines it adds
(`git log -p --unified=0 --text`), the paths of files it adds, and its message. A push
publishes every commit, so a leak that one commit adds and a later commit removes still fails,
at the commit that added it. A merge is diffed against its first parent. A removed line never
counts, so a commit that only deletes a leak passes. Binary files are scanned as text, and long
lines are scanned in linear time.

`--text-file <file>` scans every line of a file, such as a PR title or body before it is posted.

## Output never echoes a secret

A finding prints as `file:line  category`, prefixed in a range scan by the 12-character sha of
the commit that added it. A finding in a commit message adds
`(commit message)`, and a finding in a file name adds `(file name)`. If a file path itself
matches, the matched part is shown as `[redacted]`. Nothing prints the matched text or the
deny-list entry. That rule covers stdout, stderr, `--json`, and the error messages about a
broken deny-list, which name the problem but never quote the file. `src/__tests__/leak-scan.test.ts`
enforces this by searching every output stream for the fixture entries.

`--json` prints `{ "denylist": "ok" | "missing" | "empty" | "unreadable", "findings": [...] }`.
Each finding holds `site`, `file`, `line`, `category` and `fingerprint`, and `commit` in a range
scan. The fingerprint is a short
hash of the category, entry, file and line text. A later slice uses it as the override key.

| 2    | the scan cannot pass: the deny-list is missing or unreadable, the range is not `<from>..<to>`, git could not read it, or the flags are wrong |

A deny-list that parses but has no entries counts as missing. A missing deny-list and an
unreadable one are reported differently on stderr, but both fail
closed. The scan still enforces `home-path`, which needs no file. It exits 1 if that finds
something, and 2 otherwise, because a scan without the owner's entries has not shown the text
is clean. An unreadable file is one that exists but cannot be read, is not valid JSON, or has the
wrong shape.

## Checking a branch by hand

```sh
agent-chat leak-scan --range origin/main..HEAD
```

## The pre-push hook on every spawned agent

Every agent the broker spawns carries `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=1`, `GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0=core.hooksPath` and
`GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_0=<agent-chat home>/git-hooks` in its environment. git reads these as
command-line config, so every repository the agent pushes from uses the guard's hooks, and no
repository's `.git/config` is written. A profile's `env` cannot set any `GIT_CONFIG_*` key. A
human's own shell has none of these variables, so the owner's pushes are unaffected.

The broker rewrites `git-hooks/` at each spawn. `pre-push` runs
`CI= TITAN_EGRESS_REQUIRE_TERMS=1 titan-egress-scan pre-push <remote>` with git's ref lines on
stdin, the same call egress-scan's own hook makes. It then runs the repository's own `pre-push`
with the same arguments and stdin. The push is refused if either one fails, and the repository's
hook runs even when the scan has already refused. The repository's hook is found with
`git rev-parse --git-path hooks` with the guard's variables removed, so a repository's own
`core.hooksPath` (husky, lefthook) is honoured.

`node` and `titan-egress-scan` are found on the agent's `PATH` when the hook runs. The hook never
bakes in a path, because a versioned node can disappear. If either is missing, the hook prints one
line starting `leak-scan: guard NOT run, this push was not scanned` that names the missing tool.
It then lets the push go ahead, still running the repository's own hook. This fails open on
purpose: a missing guard must not refuse every push from every agent, and the burndown backstop
still reports a leak that got through. The fix is to put node on the agent's `PATH` or run
`npm i -g @titan-design/egress-scan`.

Before scanning, the hook runs `titan-egress-scan --help` and looks for `pre-push`. A scanner
whose help works but lacks the command fails open with the same `guard NOT run` line and the
install hint. A scanner whose help check fails, or that passes it and then fails the scan, refuses
the push, because a guard that starts and then crashes has not shown the push is clean.

Each shim costs a shell and one git call, so only hooks that gate something are chained:
`pre-commit`, `commit-msg`, `pre-merge-commit`, `pre-rebase`, `post-checkout`, `post-merge`,
`post-rewrite`, the three `applypatch` hooks, `pre-auto-gc` and `sendemail-validate`.
`reference-transaction`, `post-index-change`, `prepare-commit-msg` and `post-commit` fire on every
commit without gating it and are not chained, so a repository's own copies of those do not run
for agents. Server-side hooks never run in an agent's repository.

What is scanned, and the rules, are egress-scan's: see its README. It exits 0 when clean, 1 on
findings and 2 on a usage or configuration error. The hook refuses on any non-zero exit.

### The private term list

egress-scan reads its private terms from `$TITAN_EGRESS_TERMS`, else
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/titan-egress/private-terms`: one term per line, mode 0600,
never in any repository. The hook sets `TITAN_EGRESS_REQUIRE_TERMS=1`, so while that file is
missing every agent push is refused with one line naming the file to create. The hook also clears
`CI`, because egress-scan never reads the term list when `CI` is set.

`MISSING_TERMS_REFUSES` in `src/leak-guard/hooks-dir.ts` is the switch. Set to `false`, the hook
stops requiring the list, and a push with no list goes ahead, scanned with the generic rules only,
after a `leak-scan: WARNING` line naming the file.

Two gaps remain until titan-platform TP-559 lands. An empty term list loads and passes, so
creating an empty file silences the refusal without enforcing anything. And any other entry point
that runs egress-scan with a `CI` value skips the terms without saying so.

The owner's escape hatch for an emergency is `git push` from their own shell, which carries no
`GIT_CONFIG_*` variables and so runs no guard hook.

The hook alone does not stop an agent that tries to skip it. `git push --no-verify` skips every
pre-push hook, and `git -c core.hooksPath=<dir> push` points git elsewhere, since command-line
config overrides the environment. The PreToolUse bypass guard in a later slice (S4) denies both.
