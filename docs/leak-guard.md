# Leak guard

agent-chat is a public repository, and a branch is public the moment it is pushed. The leak
guard scans text before it leaves the machine and refuses when it finds private data. This page
covers slice 1 of CC-265: the deny-list, the scanner and `agent-chat leak-scan`. The pre-push
hook, the PreToolUse guard, the burndown backstop and the owner override are later slices.

## The deny-list

The deny-list is `private-denylist.json` in the agent-chat home (`~/.agent-chat/` unless
`AGENT_CHAT_HOME` moves it). The owner writes it by hand and keeps it at mode 0600. No
repository holds it, no fixture copies it, and the scanner never prints its entries.

```json
{
  "owner-email": ["someone@example.com"],
  "private-name": ["a-seat-name", "a-private-repo"],
  "private-path": ["some/private/dir/"]
}
```

Every key is optional. Any other key, a non-string entry or an empty entry makes the file
unreadable rather than silently dropping the entry.

`~/projects/<repo>` paths are not flagged, because public docs already use them.

A built-in allow-list lets synthetic fixtures pass: `/Users/example`, `/home/example`,
`/Users/test*`, and any address at `example.com`, `example.org`, `*.test` or `*.invalid`. It
applies to the matched span only, so `/Users/example/x` passes while the real home still fails.
Tests must use these forms or other made-up values, never captured real data.

## What is scanned

`--range <from>..<to>` scans the lines that the range adds (`git diff --unified=0 --text`), the
paths of files that the range adds, and the commit messages in the range. A removed line never
counts, so a commit that deletes a leak passes. Binary files are scanned as text, and long lines
are scanned in linear time.

`--text-file <file>` scans every line of a file, such as a PR title or body before it is posted.

## Output never echoes a secret

A finding prints as `file:line  category`. A finding in a commit message adds
`(commit message)`, and a finding in a file name adds `(file name)`. If a file path itself
matches, the matched part is shown as `[redacted]`. Nothing prints the matched text or the
deny-list entry. That rule covers stdout, stderr, `--json`, and the error messages about a
broken deny-list, which name the problem but never quote the file. `src/__tests__/leak-scan.test.ts`
enforces this by searching every output stream for the fixture entries.

`--json` prints `{ "denylist": "ok" | "missing" | "unreadable", "findings": [...] }`. Each
finding holds `site`, `file`, `line`, `category` and `fingerprint`. The fingerprint is a short
hash of the category, entry, file and line text. A later slice uses it as the override key.

## Exit codes

| 0    | clean, with a readable deny-list                                                                                                             |
| 1    | at least one finding                                                                                                                         |
| 2    | the scan cannot pass: the deny-list is missing or unreadable, the range is not `<from>..<to>`, git could not read it, or the flags are wrong |

A missing deny-list and an unreadable one are reported differently on stderr, but both fail
closed. The scan still enforces `home-path`, which needs no file. It exits 1 if that finds
something, and 2 otherwise, because a scan without the owner's entries has not shown the text
is clean. An unreadable file is one that exists but cannot be read, is not valid JSON, or has the
wrong shape.
